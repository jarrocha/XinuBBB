This directory holds Xinu sources for the Beaglebone Black.

If you followed the
[jarrocha/XinuBBB](https://github.com/jarrocha/XinuBBB/tree/main)
instructions and your Beaglebone Black fails to boot Xinu with this
error, then you may need to modify your `uEnv.txt` file.

    Running uenvcmd ...
    reading xinu.boot
    ##### bytes read in 10 ms (#.# MiB/s)
    Wrong Image Format for bootm command
    ERROR: can't get kernel image!

In that case, use this `uEnv.txt` file with the build's `xinu` binary
(no extension) instead.  This uEnv file gives the binary's memory
location to both fatload and the `bootm` command.

    bootfile=xinu
    memloc=0x81000000
    boot_mmc=fatload mmc 0 ${memloc} ${bootfile}; bootm ${memloc}
    uenvcmd=run boot_mmc
